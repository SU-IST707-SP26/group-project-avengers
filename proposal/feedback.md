Ok, this is a fine start, and checks all the boxes.  However, your stakeholder analysis is lacking, and I'd like you to push it a little further.  This is a *requirement* - if you don't tighten your stakeholder analysis you will not achieve as good a grade as you might otherwise.

I want you come up with one particular stakeholder.  This is your market, your customer.  Use the tools I described previously.  What does this person want?  How will they use your tool?  What are they trying to achieve?

For instance, if your stakeholder is city transportation agencies, *why* do they need insight?  What are they planning on doing with the information?  You are proposing to predict taxi trip duration and whether or not congestion pricing is applied.  How does this specific functionality address the city transportation officials need?  Tell me the story about someone who's going to use your tool.  Right now, I don't really see why the transportation agencies would care about your predictions.

There might be an argument that customers could benefit - imagine an app, that gives the user a forecast of travel time / cost.  But you'd better make sure that your model is incorporating all relevant variables - time, events (say, a Yankees game, or a big Broadway show), weather.  And aren't there apps that already do this?  Can you beat them?  Are you going to do something different than contestants did here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction?

What about https://github.com/ashx010/taxi_fare_prediction?

You're walking into a fairly crowded space here.  If you want to do something novel, you better think hard about the problem you're trying to solve.
